Simple splitting application that allows you to split large images into several pieces. Good for turning tilesets into individual tiles, facesets into individual faces, etc.

Example usage. I found a set of Face graphcis that I wanted to use in my game. But I am programming my engine to accept individual files. I start with these graphics.
